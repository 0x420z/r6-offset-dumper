# r6-offset-dumper
Offset Dumper for Rainbow Six Siege [Lion Dumper]

This Project uses Signatures to find Offsets. If the Offset it is looking for is found it will proceed to print it.
It is a very simple project. And I decided to make this since all the other "Dumpers" are not getting frequent updates.

If you would like to implement this code. Remove the subtraction of the module address.
